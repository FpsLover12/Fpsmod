Dear LunaxOptimizer users,

I want to reassure you that our mod is completely safe. Despite receiving numerous emails and messages claiming that our mod is a virus, I can guarantee you that it's not. Our primary goal is to enhance people's fps and ping. Four years ago, I was using a Dell Optiplex and was only achieving 60 fps on a client max. After using our mod, I tested my old Optiplex and reached around 100-130 fps. Our team is committed to continuously improving this mod. Here are some reasons why you can trust us:

- We have a 0/64 rating on Virustotal (you can verify this)
- Our mod is a .jar file, not a .exe, which can be questionable
- Many users have downloaded our mod and have been satisfied with the results

If you require further information, please feel free to contact me at lunaxcraftz@gmail.com.

Thank you for your trust and support.
